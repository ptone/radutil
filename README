radutil and radcmd are a pair of administrative tools to manage a radmind server

This is currently an experimental version

radutil is a Python library providing functions for management tasks, and radcmd is a command line tool for this library.

Installation:
The tools can be left in the folder you downloaded them, or they can be installed as follows:

the radutil.py file needs to be in your Python path.  On OS X 10.5 this will be:
/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages

The radcmd file needs to be executable and on your path (ie /usr/local/bin)

If your radmind files in /var/radmind are owned by root (the default) you must run radcmd as root

Configuration:

The following paths are checked for a configuration file:

    '/etc/radutil.cfg',
    '/usr/local/etc/radutil.cfg',
    '/Library/Preferences/radutil.cfg',

The following defaults are provided if no config is found:

    'rad_dir':'/var/radmind/',
    'default_k_excludes': '',
    'case_sensitive': False,
    'checksum': 'sha1',
    'fsdiffpath': '.',
    
The library is documented in the docstrings, to get the usage for the command line tool,
